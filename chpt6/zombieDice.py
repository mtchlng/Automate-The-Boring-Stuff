# zombiedicebots
# zombies eat as many brains as possible without getting shot 3 times
# a cup of 13 dice, each with brains, footsteps, and shotgun
# each dice is colored
# Green dice have more brains
# red dice have more shotguns
# yellow dice have even split of brains / shotguns
# every die has 2 footstep sides

# Steps to play:
#1. Player selects 3 random dice and rolls (always roll THREE dice)
#2. Count brains and shotguns. Each brain is 1 point.
#   3 shotguns: turn ends, all acuumulated brain-points discarded
#   0-2 shotguns: the player can continue to roll to get more brains
#3. If they continue to roll dice,
#   they must use every die that came up as "footsteps"
#   they must roll 3 dice: if number of dice is > 3, they must draw extra dice
#   Able to  roll dice until all 13 dice have been rolled,
#   or 3 shotguns come up and the player loses all points accumulated that turn
#4. If someone reaches 13 brains, their turn ends and the other players finish.
#   The person with the most brains wins.
#   If there's a tie, the tied players play a tiebreaker round
